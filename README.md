**Data Collection Tecniques Projects**

This repository contains some projects carried out as part of the Data Collection Techniques course.

**Final Grade: 10**

  - Retrieval of Information from Stack Overflow

This undertaking involves accessing Stack Overflow and executing searches for particular inquiries. The aim of this project is to seek out and collect pertinent data from Stack Overflow in order to address user questions and discover resolutions to prevalent programming issues.

This project demonstrate the use of web scraping and API interactions to collect data from popular online platforms, enabling users to access and analyze information for various purposes.

  - Use of APIs (retrieval and tweeting)

The project aimed to learn how to work with APIs as an alternative source of data. I decided to get the information from the Strava API (social network for sport) and test the X API (Twitter) by publishing a series of tweets. 

This could be used to automate the publication of content on social networks using the functionalities offered by each of their APIs.

Feel free to explore the code and project details within this repository for a deeper understanding of the data collection techniques used in this project.
